  			<h2>About Me</h2>
  			<p>
  				I'm a British web developer and entrepreneur. I decided to skip the whole university thing and instead started a web design business (<a href="http://developercity.co.uk" title="Deveoper City">Developer City</a>) after leaving school in '10. Since then I've been lucky enough to work on some really great projects with some even greater people. I'm currently working on a number of projects at <a href="http://kojilabs.com" title="Koji Labs">Koji Labs</a>.
  			</p>
  			<p>
  				I wrote <em>HTML5 Foundations</em> which is available to buy at <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1118356551/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=1118356551&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=codingskyscr-21" title="HTML5 Foundations by Matt West" target="_blank">Amazon</a> and all good bookshops.
